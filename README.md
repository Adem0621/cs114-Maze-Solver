# cs113-Maze-Solver
Created a program using java to solve a maze that is inputted by the user.
This program starts by scanning the file that was inputted by the user to print the maze. Followed by a recursive function to search through the paths of the maze for the correct path to the exit. If a dead end is reached, the program will retrace its steps which were created using the character '+', and replace the wrong path with the character '.'.
